Go-karting Simulator

On join, players get the "base kart"

-- players can use in-game currency to upgrade the kart in the following ways:
    - body
    - engine
    - wheels
    - transmission

    These items can be upgraded to lvl 10, at which point they are MAX level

Players can earn the in-game currency by participating in races (happens passively) during which they race against 7
predeterminedly fast "enemy karts" the reward that they get for completeing a lap is determined by which of the "enemy karts"
they beat. For example:
    - beat none: (0.125 * maxReward)
    - enemy 1 (slowest): (0.25 * maxReward)
    - enemy 2: (0.375 * maxReward)
    - enemy 3: (0.5 * maxReward)
    - enemy 4: (0.625 * maxReward)
    - enemy 5: (0.75 * maxReward)
    - enemy 6: (0.875 * maxReward)
    - enemy 7 (fastest): (maxReward)

Players can use in-game money to purchase "eggs" that add a mini-kart (up to 4 or 5?) that race along side the player's kart to
increase earnings. This is done by a flat rate (each mini kart completeing a lap earns fixed money)

We could also add actual eggs to get pets that give a multiplier (each kart and mini-kart on the track increase earnings by X times
depending on the active pets)

Once a player beats enemy 7 (the "boss"), they will unlock the ability to purchase access to the next world (track)

The players should also have access to a garage for customizations, including
    - colors for the karts
    - liveries
    - spoilers
    - Helmet customizations?

    These can be purchased using in-game money
